What PAYS? Validate your idea and grow by solving real problems.
Join us for an exciting and insightful workshop led by Adam Berk, a renowned mentor to startups and startup accelerators worldwide. As the co-author of the highly regarded book “Startup Program Design,” Adam brings a wealth of expertise to the table. Get ready to delve into his favorite and most thought-provoking question: “What problem are you solving?” Fondly known as “WHAT PAYS” (credit to Ty Smith), this workshop will ignite a deep exploration of how startups can identify and tackle real-world challenges effectively.
During this interactive workshop, aptly named “WHAT PAYS: Unraveling Customer Problems,” we’re dedicated to helping startups discover the true essence of their entrepreneurial journey. Over the course of 45 minutes, you’ll gain invaluable insights, learn practical strategies, and discuss ways to validate your ideas and understand your customers better. This intimate and engaging session will enable you to revolutionize your approach to problem-solving, empowering your startup for lasting success in the competitive business landscape. Don’t miss this opportunity to participate in a game-changing workshop that promises to shape the future of your startup journey!
We will focus on 3-5 real startups in the room, but everyone who attends will leave with a better understanding of
What problem are you solving?
For whom are you solving this problem?
Do your customers and users know they have this problem? Are they ACTIVELY TRYING TO SOLVE IT (or have they given up, or never tried)
What are a few behavior changes you might need to test first?
Adam will keep the cohort open – anyone who attends the session will be given feedback on their worksheet and even help designing and running their first experiment or MVP after the conference!
