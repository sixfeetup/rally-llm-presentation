Product-Market Fit Workshop
August 31, 2023 | 11:00am – 11:45am
ALL
| Room 240
The single, most important step to finding product-market fit and raising capital from investors, is identifying your Ideal Customer Profile (i.e., the people who are most likely to become a paying customer – today).
A market-validated ICP is the leading indicator that you’re able to acquire customers and grow revenue in a predictable, systematic way – just as investors like us expect to see when evaluating who to meet with and invest in.
During this workshop, you will learn:
What exactly an Ideal Customer Profile is
Exactly how to create your ICP, through step-by-step instructions
Real-world examples drawn from our portfolio to illustrate each step in the process
The best practices to make sure you can pursue your ICP with confidence
After the workshop, we will:
Share a copy of our ICP template that we use with founders in our portfolio, so you can easily build your own ICP
Share a number of helpful resources so you can put your ICP to action and quickly start acquiring customers
