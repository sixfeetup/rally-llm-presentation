Visioning for Social Impact – sometimes we see a problem in the world and think to ourselves, “Someone should do something about that”. We at optiMize encourage you to ask yourself, “Why not me”? This session will guide you through problem, power, and privilege identification, and take you through the beginning steps to positively creating social impact.
