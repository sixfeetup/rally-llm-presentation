Benjamin will share expertise and insights based on more than two decades of experience in Silicon Valley and US innovation ecosystems. “Your Ideas and You: We Gotta Talk” provides a bespoke framework addressing complex innovation, big market opportunities and high functioning teams. The workshop unpacks the “little doubts” present in our innovation efforts with new insights on innovation, opportunity and teamwork. The workshop ends with a one-page framework to guide personal reflection, one to few interactions and large group experiences. This workshop is an introduction to Benjamin’s business process framework titled “Six Steps from Ideas to Scale.” “Ideas to Scale” has been an indispensable guide for entrepreneurs across the US and Europe.
