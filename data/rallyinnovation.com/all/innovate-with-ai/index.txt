| Room 144-145
Join us for an interactive workshop where businesses, both large and small, can unlock the potential of AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) to create their own ChatGPT-like applications. Discover how to extract proprietary data insights, accelerate data-driven decision-making, boost productivity, and drive innovation across industries.
What do you need to know before building your own app? There’s a lot of code behind the OpenAI chat box. Calvin will review real-world examples and share best practices for how to:
Master data gathering and extraction from multiple sources, including the challenging realm of PDFs.
Build an AI framework using Django and HTMX, integrating powerful AI models from OpenAI, LangChain, and Llama Index.
Test the framework to enhance the accuracy and relevancy of responses.
Transform data into a format that AI “bots” can understand and learn from.
Deploy the app using Kubernetes, simulating a cloud environment for easy replication on various machines.
As a bonus, all attendees will gain access to a GitHub repository packed with Python code (the ‘lingua franca of AI’) and ChatGPT-like app examples ready to be spun up on-site. Get ready to delve into the world of AI and transform your business like never before!
