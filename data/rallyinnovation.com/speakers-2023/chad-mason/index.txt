From a young age, Chad worked with materials that contained hydrogen on his family’s farm and recognized the impact decarbonizing hydrogen could have on transforming rural sustainability. Professionally, Chad worked on durability testing for hydrogen fuel cells at General Motors and conducted research on a global scale developing new electrochemical technologies in Arizona, Finland, Singapore and Michigan. Green hydrogen will be a critical steppingstone for decarbonizing industry and agriculture, especially to Chad’s home state of North Dakota where agriculture is the main economic driver, bringing in $7.3 billion in annual revenue.
