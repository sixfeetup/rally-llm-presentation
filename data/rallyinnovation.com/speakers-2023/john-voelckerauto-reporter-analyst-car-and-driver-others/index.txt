John Voelcker covers advanced auto technologies as a freelance reporter and analyst, focusing on electric vehicles and the energy ecosystem around them. He previously edited Green Car Reports for nine years, publishing more than 12,000 articles on hybrids, electric cars, and other low- and zero-emission vehicles. His work has appeared in print, online, and radio outlets that include Wired, Popular Science, Tech Review, IEEE Spectrum, and NPR’s “All Things Considered.” He splits his time between the Catskill Mountains and New York City and still hopes one day to be an international man of mystery.
