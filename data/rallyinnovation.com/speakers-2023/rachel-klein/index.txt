Rachel is a health food “nut”, so to speak. It all started with making almond butter at home and giving it away as favors at her wedding — now her company, Revival Food Co, distributes their creatively-flavored, no-sugar-added almond butters to nearly 1500 stores nationwide. Rachel lives in Indianapolis, IN with her husband, three young kids, and their jack russell terrier, livin’ the good life!
