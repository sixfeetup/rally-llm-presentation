Neil is a farmer from Camden, Indiana who produces corn and soybeans. He leads his farm’s internal development and commercialization of advanced farming technologies which encompasses machinery, industrial control hardware and aerospace systems. Neil has also built the “5G Farm” which consists of his own private LTE network that spans several hundred acres. The 5G Farm is already attracting global technology startups to Indiana as they use rural Indiana as a sandbox for testing and commercializing new technologies. Neil is also building his own 20,000 square foot “HardTech Hub” in the town of Camden to provide global tech startups with incubation space so that rural high school students in his small community can access 21st century internships and participate in the global economy.
