Mara Smith is the founder and CEO of Inspiro Tequila. She is a former attorney, corporate strategist and stay-at-home mom. Mara began her legal career at a large law firm in Chicago before joining the corporate strategy team at a Fortune 500 Company. After her twins were born prematurely, Mara made the difficult decision to leave her corporate career.She never stopped thinking about what was next. Mara always envisioned running her own company and in February of 2020 she set out on her journey to create a new tequila brand.Mara started drinking tequila when she was looking for a clean, gluten-free spirit that fit into her active lifestyle. She searched for a tequila brand that was additive-free with a look, taste and aroma that appealed to her as the consumer. That perfect tequila did not exist, so she decided to create one. The goal was not just to create a one-of-a-kind tequila, it was also to bring another female perspective to the spirits industry. Women are involved in every aspect of Inspiro Tequila’s process from creating the taste profiles to getting bottles on the shelves. As a female founder, Mara’s mission is to inspire and support other women on their entrepreneurial journeys through financial support and mentoring.
